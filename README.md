# Northcoders News Frontend

A frontend website built with react, to display the data from my [News Api](https://github.com/Slyose/fe-nc-news).

It allows the user to view articles, sort them by properties such as the quantity of comments, as well as viewing articles by topics.
The user can also submit and delete comments from the default account 'jessjelly'.

The [live version](https://modou-tji-news.netlify.app/) of this app is hosted on netlify.
The backend repo is also available on [github](https://github.com/Slyose/News-API)
